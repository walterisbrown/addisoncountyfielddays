# This is a "static site"

That means this site is bundled up into a bunch of unchangable files each time it's built.
It can be hosted anywhere really.

It's currently being hosted on netlify. 

Changes made to this repository:

https://github.com/jamesjnadeau/addisoncountyfielddays/

are automatically reflected in the live site once it's built successfully.

The sites main content is in the content folder of that repository.
The file structure of the content folder reflects the url structure of the site.

Most of the pages are made in markdown.

Some of the more complicated ones are made in an html template language known as jade, which is now called pug. Their formats are pretty interchangeable.
