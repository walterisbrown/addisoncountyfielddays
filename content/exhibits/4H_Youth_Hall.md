## THE 4-H BUILDINGS AT FIELD DAYS GROUNDS

In 1980, the Addison County 4-H Foundation assumed responsibility from the Addison
County Youth Center for the large dairy barn, the horse barn, and the youth exhibit hall at
Field Days. Field Days is a very important part of the 4-H program and 4-H has accepted
the challenge of maintaining these buildings. The Foundation’s purpose is to raise money in
support of the Addison County Educational 4-H program. The maintenance and improvement
of the 4-H facilities at Field Days is a major expense. People wishing to help 4-H may contact
any Addison 4-H Foundation Trustee Elaine Desforges, Kathy Nisun, Shelley Smith,
Jake Jacobs, Martha Seifert, Laurie Bertrand, Jeff Lester,  Janet Piper, Kari Smith, 
Victor Bolduc, Andrea Warren, Sara Kurtz, Ashley Audet, and Patrick Reen.
