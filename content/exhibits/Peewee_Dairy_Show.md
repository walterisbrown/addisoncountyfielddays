## PEEWEE DAIRY SHOWMANSHIP

SUPERINTENDENT: Robin Severy, 897-2680

Friday, 12:00 noon — Animal Show Arena

This is a show planned especially for youngsters at least 3 and under 8 1/2 years of age
who ate too young to show 4-H with any breed of dairy calf. For safety reasons, exhibitor
ages will be enforced. The emphasis is on fun and learning with identical ribbons and t-shirts
awarded to all.

A big thank you goes out to the Chalker Farm for donating the t-shirts!
